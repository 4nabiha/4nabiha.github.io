##My Interests
My hobbies include painting and reading. I absolutely love working with acrylic paint! It dries quickly, which is perfect for layering and adding texture to my paintings. Plus, acrylic paint is water-based, making it easy to clean up and work with. I usually like to reading realistic fiction. "The Kite Runner" is my all-time favorite book. Academically, I am drawn to the world of computer technology, particularly the software side.
