My GitHub account is where I will showcase my programming projects and collaborate with others.

The repository named 4nabiha is a personal website project.

To clone the repository onto my local machine, I first opened GitHub Desktop and logged into my GitHub account. Once logged in, I clicked on the "+" icon in the top left corner and selected "Clone a repository." From the list of my repositories, I chose 4nabiha. I then selected a folder on my local machine where I wanted to clone the repository. Finally, I clicked on "Clone repository," which downloaded a copy of the repository to my selected folder.
